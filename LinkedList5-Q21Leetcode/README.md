The first Method come to my mind is to have a function to sort, and in the main function name merge,

go to end of first linkedlist and attach the second linkedlist to end of first one.

But it is not efficient as Picture below:

But at the second method: in one go as described in picture below, it will be efficient and in one go, sorted list will be executed:
